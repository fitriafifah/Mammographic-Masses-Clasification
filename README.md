# Mammographic-Masses-Clasification
These projects were created to complete the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course in my fourth semester. In the project, I use Naive Bayes. The Naive Bayes method classifies data based on the probability that it could occur in the future. I did the classification using "Mammographic Masses" data.
